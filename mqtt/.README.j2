Mosquitto MQTT Server bundled with Hivemq's web client.

## About

This add-on combines the power of [Hivemq](https://www.hivemq.com/)'s web-based MQTT client,
and the powerfull [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) broker.
With this, you can host your own MQTT broker, and inspect/publish messages using the built-in web client!
